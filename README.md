## Support the List

Found something new? Found something wrong? Submit an issue or a pull request with your dogecoin address and be rewarded from the donation pool!  

Issues and pull requests are fine ways to try out GitHub, if you've never done it before.  Don't be scared:  you can do everything you need to do online right here, without install anything on your system. 

### Submit an Issue

Issues are super-easy: sign in to GitHub and [fire one off](https://github.com/kentbrew/dogefaucets/issues/new).  Since I'll have to fix it up myself, your reward may be smaller.

### Fork Your Own Copy

There are four easy steps, once you [join GitHub](https://github.com/join):

1. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/kentbrew/dogefaucets/fork) and get your own copy.
2. From your own copy, [edit README.md](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files), right here on GitHub.  
3. Again from your own copy, [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).
4. Profit!
